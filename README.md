This was originally a test set for ITV, which I have since dropped into a fresh instance of Vite to continue building out.

:heavy_check_mark: Code in pure React / TypeScript

:heavy_check_mark: No jQuery

## Original specs

More can be built out here as per the original specs of the test listed below:

### The Tasks

1. Code review: Comment on the pull request offering solutions and suggestions to improve the codebase. We have introduced a couple of errors to the application code that will stop the application running properly. Using the tools available to you find and correct the problems.

2. Add tests: Commit unit tests to the pull request to ensure the code works the way you expect.

### Interview had emphasis on...

- Understanding of SASS and BEM approach
- React hooks and modern React design patterns 
- Testing
- Relative units for measurement
- How semantic markup can make for a better end-user experience

## Available Scripts

In the root directory you can run:

### `npm install`

Will perform a usual installation of any dependencies.

### `npm run dev`

Will perform a usual launch of the dev environment.

### `npm run test`

Will perform a launch of the test suite; generating a fully 100% covered report.

## NOTE1:
